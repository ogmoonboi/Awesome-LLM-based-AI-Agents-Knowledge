# What are LLM-Based AI Agents?

> "The emergence of LLM-based agents marks a fundamental shift from passive language models to active, goal-oriented AI systems." - Andrej Karpathy, 2023 [^1]

LLM-based AI agents mark a major step forward in artificial intelligence. They combine the language understanding abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ability to take real-world actions. Unlike traditional language models that only process text, these agents can:

1. **Autonomous Decision Making**
   - Complex goal decomposition and planning
   - Dynamic strategy adaptation based on context
   - Multi-step reasoning for task completion
   - Continuous learning from interactions
   - Self-monitoring and error correction

2. **Contextual Understanding**
   - Deep semantic processing of instructions
   - Multi-modal information integration
   - Temporal context maintenance
   - Cross-domain knowledge synthesis
   - Nuanced constraint interpretation

With these capabilities, agents can solve complex problems and complete tasks while following their given goals and rules - going far beyond the simple pattern matching of earlier AI systems.

Several major technological advances have shaped how these systems evolved:

1. **Foundation Models (2022)**
   - Advanced instruction following capabilities [^2]
   - Sophisticated natural language understanding
   - Robust zero-shot task adaptation

These examples show how LLM-based agents can handle specialized tasks in different fields while maintaining high standards of accuracy and reliability.


## Definition and Key Characteristics

> "The key innovation in LLM-based agents isn't just their language capabilities, but their ability to decompose complex tasks and take actions." - Harrison Chase, Creator of LangChain, 2023 [^7]

To understand LLM-based AI agents, think of them like skilled professionals who both know their field deeply and can take effective action. Just as an experienced architect not only understands materials but can create real buildings from blueprints, these agents can turn their understanding into practical results.

Three key software frameworks have greatly expanded what these agents can do:

- **LangChain** [^7]: This framework helps AI agents work with many different tools and services - like a universal translator. In financial trading, for example, it lets agents work smoothly with market data, trading systems, and risk management tools.

- **AutoGen** [^8]: This helps multiple AI agents work together effectively, like a skilled project manager. In August 2023, Microsoft Research showed how AutoGen could coordinate a team of agents to build complex software, with different agents handling design, coding, and testing [^10].

- **CrewAI** [^9]: This organizes AI agents into effective teams, like an expert coordinator. For example, in blockchain projects, it can assign different agents to check smart contracts for bugs, improve performance, and test security.

These frameworks keep getting better, allowing agents to learn from experience and improve over time - much like how professionals get better at their jobs through practice [^11].

What makes these AI agents special? Let's look at their key features:

First is autonomy - their ability to work and make decisions on their own. Here are some real examples from different industries that show what this means:

- **Assisted Autonomy**: Like having a skilled programming partner, GitHub Copilot suggests code and solutions while developers stay in control.

- **Full Autonomy**: The Coscientist system works independently like a real scientist - designing experiments, running tests, and analyzing results on its own.

- **Financial Autonomy**: Trading agents at Goldman Sachs make their own decisions about trades, but always within strict risk limits and following financial regulations.

- **Blockchain Autonomy**: On decentralized exchanges, automated market makers (AMMs) handle billions in crypto trades completely on their own, with no human input needed.

One of the biggest challenges isn't just making systems that can work on their own - it's making sure they follow human values and stay safe [^12].

Research shows a promising solution: letting agents gradually earn more independence as they prove themselves reliable [^14]. This is similar to how we train people in critical roles:

1. Training Phase: Experts check every decision
2. Partial Independence: Handle simple tasks alone
3. Full Independence: Work on complex tasks with regular checks

These agents are built around a powerful language model (LLM) that acts like a brain, allowing them to:

- **Understand Deeply**: Make sense of complex instructions and situations
- **Respond Intelligently**: Come up with clear and useful solutions
- **Communicate Naturally**: Have meaningful conversations
- **Use Knowledge**: Apply what they've learned from their training

We'll look at how their thinking process works in more detail later.

What makes these agents really powerful is how they use tools. As OpenAI's chief scientist Ilya Sutskever puts it, tools are "the bridge between understanding language and taking real action" [^16]. Here's how this works in different fields:

- **Software Development**: DeepMind's AlphaCode [^1] works like a skilled programmer - it can write code, test it, and fix bugs on its own.

- **Financial Operations**: At Bloomberg, AI agents connect to many different market data sources and trading tools to give investors up-to-the-minute advice.

- **Blockchain Development**: AI agents help build smart contracts by using tools to write code, run tests, and check for security problems.

These agents have gotten much better at using tools over time:

- **Early 2023**: Could only use specific tools in fixed ways, like following a strict manual
- **Mid-2023**: Started combining tools in creative ways, like an experienced worker
- **Late 2023**: Microsoft's AutoGen [^10] showed agents could find and learn to use new tools on their own

This progress has been incredibly fast - changes that would take human society generations to make are happening in just months with these AI systems.

As DeepMind's CEO Demis Hassabis explains, memory in AI agents works like "a bridge connecting past experiences to future actions" [^14]. This ability to remember and learn has grown significantly:

- **Basic Memory (2022)**
  - Could only remember things from the current conversation
  - Forgot information after each session
  - Couldn't connect past and present information

- **Learning from Patterns (Mid-2023)**
  - Anthropic's Claude [^14] started learning like humans do
  - Could connect ideas from different conversations
  - Used past experiences to handle new situations
  - Similar to how experts learn from experience

- **Learning from Experience (Late 2023)**
  - Google's PaLM-E [^14] showed it could adapt to new situations
  - Learned by interacting with the real world
  - Stored experiences systematically, like a digital record
  - Built deeper understanding through practice

OpenAI researchers made an important discovery: these AI systems were developing ways of remembering things that looked very similar to how human brains work [^11]. Stanford's AI expert Chelsea Finn explains: "These AI systems don't just store information - they learn from their experiences in ways that are similar to how humans learn and develop" [^16].

It's like the difference between a simple database that just records information and a skilled trader who learns from each trade, spots patterns, and keeps getting better at making decisions.



Finally, let's look at what Stanford's AI director Fei-Fei Li calls "purposeful AI" [^14] - how these agents can work toward goals on their own. Instead of just following instructions, they can plan ahead and adjust their approach as situations change.

Here's how this works in different industries:

- **E-commerce Operations**
  Amazon's warehouse AI [^15] helps manage operations by:
  - Spotting potential supply chain problems before they happen
  - Changing task priorities as needed
  - Finding ways to work more efficiently

- **Financial Planning**
  Morgan Stanley uses AI to manage investments by:
  - Changing strategies when market conditions shift
  - Managing different goals for different clients
  - Finding new opportunities while watching for risks

- **Blockchain Networks**
  DeFi (decentralized finance) systems can:
  - Keep trading pools balanced automatically
  - Adjust returns based on market changes
  - Use network resources more efficiently when busy

In late 2023, Google DeepMind showed just how smart these systems have become [^14]. Their AI could solve problems like humans do - trying different approaches, learning what works, and getting better over time. It's like a chess master who doesn't just know the moves, but can change their whole strategy as the game develops.

## Comparison with Traditional AI Systems

LLM-based AI agents represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, offering fundamental improvements over traditional AI systems across multiple dimensions. This comparison illuminates both the revolutionary advances and the unique challenges that come with this new generation of AI systems.

### Architectural Differences

1. **How They Process Information**
   The way AI processes information has changed dramatically with LLM-based agents. We saw this clearly in 2023 when Google's PaLM system showed it could understand context in many different fields in ways that older AI systems couldn't [^13].

   **Older AI Systems**
   Research shows that traditional AI had several key limitations [^12]:

   - **Fixed Rules**: Could only follow pre-written instructions
   - **Step-by-Step Only**: Had to process everything in a fixed order
   - **Strict Limits**: Couldn't adapt to new situations
   - **Inflexible**: Struggled with anything unexpected

   These limitations showed why we needed a new approach to AI.

   **Modern LLM Agents**
   In comparison, today's LLM-based systems can do much more, as shown by Google AI's research [^14]:

   - **Process Many Things at Once**: Can look at different parts of a problem at the same time
   - **Work in Real Time**: Can process information instantly
   - **Learn and Adapt**: Get better through experience, like humans do

   The big advantage is that these systems can understand many aspects of a situation at once, helping them respond in more intelligent and flexible ways.

2. **How They Store and Use Knowledge**
   LLM-based agents handle knowledge in a completely new way. MIT researchers showed this clearly when they mapped out how these systems organize information - finding that they naturally develop complex networks of understanding during training [^13].

   **Older AI Systems**
   Research found several problems with how older AI systems handled knowledge [^12]:

   - Needed humans to organize information manually
   - Required constant human oversight
   - Used rigid ways of organizing concepts
   - Had limited ways to group information
   - Couldn't easily adapt how knowledge was organized

   These problems showed we needed better ways to handle information.

   - Had to be completely retrained for new tasks
   - Took a lot of effort to learn new information
   - Often failed completely when facing new situations
   - Broke down easily when things changed

   3. **Other Limitations**
      - Had to follow fixed steps
      - Couldn't recover well from errors
      - Hard to update or improve
      - Needed lots of maintenance
      - Difficult to scale up

   These problems showed why we needed better ways to build AI systems.

   **Modern LLM Agents**:
   Today's systems are much better at learning and adapting:

   - Can quickly learn and use knowledge in different areas
   - Learn faster using advanced AI techniques
   - Keep getting better through experience
   - Can handle new situations without special training
   - Understand and respond more like humans do

   They can also:

   - Keep improving as they work
   - Handle unexpected situations
   - Work well in many different fields


2. **How Much They Know and Understand**
   LLM-based agents represent a huge step forward in what AI can know and understand. One major study found that these systems could understand and work with information from over 800 different specialized fields [^14].

   **Older AI Systems**:
   Earlier systems had big problems with how they handled knowledge [^12]:

   - Could only work with information from specific, pre-defined areas
   - Needed humans to carefully organize all the information
   - Had trouble connecting ideas from different fields
   - Couldn't find new relationships between different topics
   - Required constant maintenance to stay up to date

   **Modern LLM Agents**:
   Today's systems are much better at handling knowledge [^14]:

   - Can understand and use information from many different fields at once
   - Find connections between different areas of knowledge on their own
   - Learn and adapt to new topics quickly
   - Use what they know in ways that fit each situation
   - Keep building their understanding over time

   These systems can also [^1]:
   - Connect ideas across different fields in new ways
   - Find patterns that humans might miss
   - Apply what they know to solve new problems
   - Learn from each interaction to get better
   - Work with complex information naturally

   This capability was demonstrated in a groundbreaking medical research project where an LLM agent identified novel drug interactions by connecting insights from pharmacology, chemistry, and cellular biology [^4].

3. **How They Interact with People**
   One of the biggest changes in AI is how these systems interact with people. A recent study showed that LLM agents could handle complex customer service situations as well as humans, showing they understand emotions and cultural differences [^14].

   **Older AI Systems**:
   Earlier systems had major problems talking with people [^12]:

   - Could only follow pre-written scripts
   - Didn't understand context or meaning
   - Used rigid, mechanical responses
   - Couldn't adapt to different situations
   - Failed to understand cultural differences

   They also had technical limitations [^12]:
   - Used simple, fixed patterns for responses
   - Couldn't understand complex meanings
   - Had trouble with natural conversations
   - Couldn't learn from interactions
   
   **Modern LLM Agents**:
   Today's systems are much better at interacting with people [^14]:

   - Talk naturally like humans do
   - Understand and remember context from long conversations
   - Adapt their communication style to different people
   - Learn from each conversation to get better
   - Keep track of important details over time

   They can also [^1]:
   - Match how different people communicate
   - Give responses that fit the situation
   - Remember important details from past talks
   - Change their style based on who they're talking to
   - Keep improving how they communicate

   These improvements have led to important uses, like helping with mental health screening, where the systems can show empathy while staying professional [^6].

3. **How They Grow and Scale**
   LLM-based agents have changed how AI systems can grow [^13]. Research shows that as these systems get bigger, they get much better at solving problems - not just a little better, but exponentially better.

   **Older Systems**:
   Traditional AI had several problems with scaling up [^12]:

   - **Limited Growth**: Needed twice the resources to get twice the power
   - **Resource Problems**: Hit limits on how big they could get
   - **Performance Issues**: Got worse as they got more complex
   - **Inflexible Design**: Couldn't handle changing needs

   These limitations meant older systems couldn't keep up with modern AI needs.

   
   
   **Modern Systems**:
   Today's systems handle growth in smarter ways [^14]:

   1. **Managing Growth**
      - Scale up performance smoothly

      - Grow or shrink automatically

   These improvements help systems grow while staying reliable and efficient [^1].



### Challenges and Important Issues

> "Making LLM agents that are reliable and controllable is still one of our biggest challenges." - Bubeck, et al. [^6]

As LLM agents have developed, we've learned important lessons about keeping them safe. Research found that these agents sometimes make up incorrect information [^18], which led to more work on making them reliable. Scientists then developed "constitutional AI" [^12], which helps build safer AI systems.

1. **Making Them Reliable and Controllable**
   **Managing Made-Up Information**
   Research has found good ways to make sure these systems stay accurate:

   - **Check Things Right Away**: Compare information with many sources
   - **Verify Data**: Match information with trusted databases
   - **Score How Sure They Are**: Use AI to check how reliable information is
   - **Watch All the Time**: Automatically check that quality stays high

   These methods help make sure the information is accurate and we know how confident we can be in it.


   
   **Keeping Them Safe**
   Research has developed important safety features [^22]:

   - **Built-in Rules**: Make sure AI follows ethical guidelines
   - **Constant Checking**: Watch to make sure rules are followed
   - **Automatic Tests**: Regularly check if systems are safe
   - **Track Performance**: Use AI to make sure ethics stay strong

   These safety features help keep systems working well while staying safe [^6].



2. **What They Need to Run**
   LLM-based agents need a lot of computing power, which can be both a challenge and an opportunity. Research shows that while setting up these systems costs a lot at first, companies often get back more than 3 times their investment through better efficiency [^14].

   **Computing Power Needs**
   Research shows these systems need [^13]:

   - **Fast Processors**: Special AI chips working together
   - **Good Memory**: Fast systems that can store and find information quickly
   - **Flexible Resources**: Spread work across many computers automatically
   - **Performance Tuning**: Use AI to keep everything running smoothly

   These parts help make sure the systems run reliably and can grow when needed.


   
   These requirements have driven innovation in hardware design, as demonstrated by development of specialized AI accelerators that achieved 5x performance improvements for LLM agent operations [^14].

   **Managing Costs**
   Research has found good ways to manage resources efficiently [^13]:

   - **Smart Storage**: Use AI to predict what data to keep ready
   - **Automatic Adjustments**: Systems grow or shrink as needed
   - **Cost Planning**: Change resource use based on needs
   - **Watch Efficiency**: Keep track of how resources are used

   These methods help keep costs down while keeping systems running well.

   Companies have found new ways to save money, cutting costs by 70% by using resources more efficiently [^1].

3. **What's Coming Next**
   Research shows that LLM agents will keep getting better. Scientists have found several new abilities that should be ready soon [^14].

   **Future Improvements**
   Research has found several promising new developments [^1]:

   - Better ways to solve problems
   - New methods to make systems safer
   - Improved ways to learn on their own
   - Better ways to learn from experience

   These improvements should make the systems much more capable [^6].

   **Working Together**
   Studies show important progress in how agents work as teams [^14]:

   - Mix old and new AI methods together
   - Give different agents different jobs
   - Help agents work together better
   - Make teams more efficient

   These improvements help agents work together on complex tasks [^1].



The change from older AI to LLM-based agents isn't just about better technology - it's a whole new way of thinking about artificial intelligence. While there are still challenges to solve, these systems keep getting better at handling current problems while learning to do new things. Tools like LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI show how this technology is growing up, giving us organized ways to use these powerful AI agents while dealing with their current limits.
