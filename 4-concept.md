- **Autonomous Treasury**: Self-managing DAO operations with privacy

## Summary

> "The integration of AI agents with DeFi protocols - from automated trading to privacy-preserving computation - creates financial systems that are greater than the sum of their parts." - Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, NYU, 2024 [^12]

We've explored how AI agents combine the best of decentralized finance, artificial intelligence, cryptography, and distributed systems. As these DeFi agents get smarter, they're creating a new generation of financial systems - ones that are more capable, secure, and automated than ever before. These systems can handle complex markets while keeping everything private and trustworthy. The future of finance is here, and it's powered by AI!
