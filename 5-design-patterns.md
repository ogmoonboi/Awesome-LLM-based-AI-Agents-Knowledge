| Summary: | Proactive goal creator anticipates users’ goals by understanding human interactions and capturing the context via relevant tools. |
| Context: | Users explain the goals that the agent is expected to achieve in the prompt. |
| Problem: | The context information collected via solely a dialogue interface may be limited, and result in inaccurate responses to users’ goals. |
| Forces: | - Underspecification. (i) Users may not be able to provide thorough context information and specify precise goals to agents. (ii) Agents can only retrieve limited information from the memory. <br> - Accessibility. Users with specified disabilities may not be able to directly interoperate with the agent via passive goal creator. |
| Benefits: | - Interactivity. An agent can interact with users or other agents by anticipating their decisions proactively with captured multimodal context information. <br> - Goal-seeking. The multimodal input can provide more detailed information for the agent to understand users’ goals, and increase the accuracy and completeness of goal achievement. <br> - Accessibility. Additional tools can help capture the sentiments and other context information from disabled users, ensuring accessibility and broadening the human values of LLM-based agents. |
| Drawbacks: | - Overhead. (i) Proactive goal creator is enabled by the multimodal context information captured by relevant tools, which may increase the cost of the agent. (ii) Limited context information may increase the communication overhead between users and agents. |
| Related patterns: | - Passive goal creator. Proactive goal creator can be regarded an alternative of passive goal creator enabling multimodal context injection. <br> - Prompt/response optimiser. Proactive goal creator can first handle users’ inputs and transfer the goals and relevant context information to prompt/response optimiser for prompt refinement. <br> - Multimodal guardrails. Multimodal guardrails can help process the multimodal data captured by proactive goal creator. |
| Examples: | - GestureGPT can decipher users’ hand gesture descriptions and hence comprehend users’ intents. <br> - ProAgent can observe the behaviours of other teammate agents, deduce their intentions, and adjust the planning accordingly. |

| Summary: | Prompt/response optimiser refines the prompts/responses according to the desired input or output content and format.
| Context: | Users may struggle with writing effective prompts, especially considering the injection of comprehensive context. Similarly, it may be difficult for users to understand the agent’s outputs in certain cases. |
| Problem: | How to generate effective prompts and standardised responses that are aligned with users’ goals or objectives? |
| Forces: | - Standardisation. Prompts and responses may vary in structure, format, and content, which will lead to potential confusion or inconsistent behaviours of the agent. <br> - Goal alignment. Ensuring that prompts and responses are aligned with the ultimate goal or objective can facilitate the agent to achieve desired results. <br> - Interoperability. The generated prompts and responses may be directly input to other components, external tools or agents for completing further tasks. |
| Benefits: | - Standardisation. Prompt/response optimiser can create standardised prompts and responses regarding the requirements specified in the template. <br> - Goal alignment. The optimised prompts and responses adhere to user-defined conditions, hence they can achieve higher accuracy and relevance to the goals. <br> - Interoperability. Interoperability between agent and external tools is facilitated by prompt/response optimiser, which can provide consistent and well-defined prompts and responses for task execution. <br> - Adaptability. Prompt/response optimiser can accommodate differentconstraints, specifications, or domain-specific requirements by refining the template with a knowledge base. |
| Drawbacks: | - Underspecification. In certain cases, it may be difficult for prompt/response optimiser to capture and incorporate all relevant contextual information effectively, especially considering the ambiguity of users’ input, and dependency on context engineering. Consequently, the optimiser may struggle to generate appropriate prompts or responses. <br> - Maintenance overhead. Updating and maintaining prompt or response templates may cause significant overhead. Changes in requirements may necessitate modifying multiple templates, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
| Related patterns: | - Passive goal creator and proactive goal creator can first handle users’ inputs and transfer the goals and relevant context information to prompt/response optimiser for prompt refinement. <br> - Self-reflection, cross-reflection, and human-reflection. The reflection patterns can be applied to assess and refine the output of prompt/response optimiser. <br> - Agent adapter. Prompt/response optimiser can improve users’ inputs, and the optimised prompts can be sent to other agents for goal achievement, while agent adapter focuses more on the utilisation of external tools.
| Examples: | - LangChain provides prompt templates for practitioners to develop custom LLM-based agents. <br> - Amazon Bedrock Users can configure prompt templates in Amazon Bedrock, defining how the agent should evaluate and use the prompts. <br> - Dialogflow allows users to create generators to specify agent behaviours and responses at runtime.|

| Facts | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Summary: | Retrieval augmented generation techniques enhance the knowledge updatability of agents for goal achievement, and maintain data privacy of on-premise LLM-based agents/systems implementations.
| Context: | LLM-based agents are not equipped with knowledge related to explicitly specific domains, especially on highly confidential and privacy-sensitive local data, unless they are fine-tuned for pre-trained using domain data.|
| Problem: | Given a task, how can agents conduct reasoning with data/knowledge that are not learned by the LLMs through model training? |
| Forces: | - Lack of knowledge. The reasoning process may be unreliable when the agent is required to accomplish domain-specific tasks that the agent has no such knowledge reserve. <br> - Overhead. Fine-tuning large LLM using local data or training a large LLM locally consumes high amount of computation and resource costs. <br> - Data Privacy. Local data are confidential to be used to train or fine-tune the models.
| Benefits: | - Knowledge retrieval. Agents can search and retrieve knowledge related to the given tasks, which ensures the reliability of reasoning steps. <br> - Updatability. The prompts/responses generated using RAG by the agent on internal or online data are updatable by the complimentary parameterised knowledge. <br> - Data privacy. The agent can retrieve additional knowledge from local datastores, which ensures data privacy and security. <br> Cost-efficiency. Under the data privacy constraint, RAG can provide essential knowledge to the agent without training a new LLM entirely. This reduced the training costs. |
| Drawbacks: | - Maintenance overhead. Maintenance and update of the parameterised knowledge in the vector store requires additional computation and storage costs. <br> - Data limitation. The agents still mainly rely on the data it has been trained on to generate prompts. This can impact the quality and accuracy of the generated content in those specific domains.
| Related patterns: | Retrieval augmented generation can complement all other patterns by providing extra context information from the local datastore.
| Examples: | - Linkedin applies RAG to construct the pipeline of LLM based agents, which can search appropriate Womancase studies to respond users.|

     - Sees the whole project at once
     - Plans everything perfectly
     - Like having a visionary leader
     - Makes complex things simple
     - Gets you to your goal

| Facts | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Summary: | The LLM is accessed in a single instance to generate all necessary steps for the plan. |
| Context: | When users interact with the agent for specific goals, the included LLM is queried for plan generation. |
| Problem: | How can the agent generate the steps for a plan efficiently? |
| Forces: | - Efficiency. For certain pressing tasks, the agent should be able to conduct planning and respond in a short amount of time. <br> - Overhead. Users need to pay for each interaction with commercial LLMs. |
| Benefits: | - Efficiency. The agent can generate a plan to achieve users’ goals by querying the underlying LLM only once, which saves consumed time. <br> - Cost-efficiency. Users’ expenses can be reduced since the LLM is queried for one time. <br> - Simplicity. One-shot model querying can satisfy the tasks that do not require complex action plans.
| Drawbacks: | - Oversimplification. For complex tasks, one-shot model querying may not be able to fully capture all requirements at one time, hence oversimplifying the tasks and cannot return a correct response. <br> - Lack of explainability. One-shot model querying may suffer the lack of explainability as the incorporated LLM is queried only once, which may not provide detailed reasoning steps for plan generation. <br> - Size of the context window. The response quality may be constrained considering the LLMs’ current capability of handling long conversational contexts and the token limits. |
| Related patterns: | - Incremental model querying. Incremental model querying can be regarded an alternative of one-shot model querying with iteration. <br> - Single-path plan generator. One-shot model querying enables the generation of single-path plans by only querying the LLM for one time.<br> - Multimodal guardrails. Multimodal guardrails serve as an intermediate layer, managing the inputs and outputs of model querying.|
| Examples: | One-shot model querying can be considered configuration or use by default when a user is leveraging a LLM, while CoT and Zero-shot-CoT both exemplify this pattern |

| Facts | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Summary: | Incremental model querying involves accessing the LLM at each step of the plan generation process. |
| Context: | When users interact with the agent for specific goals, the included LLM is queried for plan generation. |
| Problem: | The LLM may struggle to generate the correct response at the first attempt. How can the agent conduct an accurate reasoning process?
| Forces: | - Size of the context window. The context window of a LLM may be limited, hence users may not be able to provide a complete and comprehensive prompt. <br> - Oversimplification. The reasoning process may be oversimplified and hence endure uncertainties with only one attempt of model querying. <br> - Lack of explainability. The generated responses of LLMs require detailed reasoning process to preserve explainability and eventual trustworthiness. |
| Benefits: | - Supplementary context. Incremental model querying allows users to split the context in multiple prompts to address the issue of limited context window. <br> - Reasoning certainty. LLMs will iteratively refine the reasoning steps by self-checking or feedback from users. <br> - Explainability. Users can query the LLM to provide detailed reasoning steps through incremental model querying. |

### Agent Adapter Design Pattern

<img src="assets/design-pattern-agent-adapter.png" alt="Agent Adapter Design Pattern Design Pattern" width="100%">

Given user’s instructions, the agent generates a plan consisting of a set of tasks to achieve the user’s goals. In particular, the agent may employ diverse external tools to complete different tasks. However, tools have respective interfaces, which can be of different abstraction levels for the agent to deal with, or have specific format requirements, etc. Agent adapter can help invoke and manage these interfaces by converting the agent messages into required format or content, and vice versa. In particular, the adapter can retrieve tool manual or tutorial from datastore, to acquire available interfaces and learn the usage. It then transforms the agent outputs based on the interface requirements and invokes the service. Please note that fine-grained interface description can enhance agent understanding and hence improve the performance. The adapter also receives execution results from tools, which will be sent to the underlying LLM for further analysis (e.g. task assignment to other tools, self-reflection for tool employment). For instance, the adapter can translate tasks into system messages when interacting with local file system, or capture and operate graphical user interface when playing a video game.

## Pattern Selection and Adoption Strategy

<img src="assets/design-pattern-adoption-strategy.png" alt="Pattern Selection Criteria" width="100%">

Think of this as your architectural blueprint toolkit. Each design challenge you face has multiple solutions - some patterns are alternatives to each other, while others work together to create more powerful systems. We've highlighted each pattern's strengths in green and trade-offs in orange to help you make informed decisions. For clarity, we focus on what makes each pattern unique, and since they're designed to work independently, you can implement them in any order that suits your project. Let's explore your options: If the agent is expected to capture users’ environmental information as supplementary context, proactive goal creator can be applied to analyse users’ goals based on the data captured by a series of sensors. In this case, the agent can also serve users with specified disabilities. Whilst, passive goal creator can provide a simple and efficient dialogue interface to interact with users. 

Once you have your goals, the Prompt/Response Optimizer helps ensure clear communication by converting user instructions into standardized prompts. Need more information? The Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern lets your agent tap into external knowledge bases for additional context. When it comes to querying your foundation model, you have two options: use Incremental Model Querying for thorough, multi-step processing when accuracy is crucial, or One-Shot Model Querying for efficient, single-pass processing when working with budget constraints. 

When planning how to achieve a goal, you can choose between two approaches: the Single-Path Plan Generator for straightforward, efficient solutions, or the Multi-Path Plan Generator when you need to offer choices and ensure your system adapts to different user preferences. To validate these plans, you have several reflection patterns at your disposal: Self-Reflection for autonomous improvement, Cross-Reflection for peer review, and Human Reflection for direct user feedback. Want to leverage multiple agents? They can collaborate through Voting-Based, Role-Based, or Debate-Based cooperation patterns, each offering unique benefits for different scenarios. 

Security and reliability are crucial for any AI system. The Multimodal Guardrails pattern acts as your security checkpoint, using both rule-based and AI-powered checks to protect your foundation model from harmful inputs and prevent skewed outputs. Need to work with external tools? The Tool/Agent Registry pattern helps you discover and manage the right components for each task. The Agent Adapter pattern makes integration smooth and cost-effective by handling all the interface conversions for you. Before deployment, use the Agent Evaluator pattern to thoroughly test your system and ensure it meets all functional requirements.
