# The Agentic World: A Future World enabled by LLM-based AI Agents

## Introduction

We are still in AI Agent, but as autonomous becomes more and more accessable, we believe agentic AI will become reality, and the "agentic world" will become true. This [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/09/06/agentic-ai-the-next-big-breakthrough-thats-transforming-business-and-technology/) listed the key difference between AI Agents and Agentic AI, and this "agentic world" is poised to redefine industries, labor markets, and human-AI interactions.


| Aspect | AI Agent | Agentic AI |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Autonomy Level | Limited autonomy, needs human input | Highly autonomous, can act independently |
| Goal-Oritentation | Task-specific, follows set instructions | Goal-drive, solves problems on its own |
| Learning Capailities | May not learn or only learn within set rules | Continuous learning and improves |
| Complexity | Handles smpler, more structured tasks | Handles complex, dynamic environments |
| Decision-Making Process | Pre-programmed responses to inputs | Makes decisions based on reasoning and analysis | 
| Interactions with Environments | Reacts to set inputs but doesn't adapt | Actively adapts to surroundings and changes | 
| Responsiveness to Change | Limited ability to adapt to new situations | Changes its goals and methods autonomously |


## Understanding the Agentic World

In an agentic world, AI agents operate autonomously, performing complex tasks with minimal human intervention. These agents leverage advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and real-time data analysis to function effectively in both digital and physical environments.

Examples of AI agents already influencing our world include:
- Personal assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant
- Financial trading bots that make rapid investment decisions
- Autonomous vehicles navigating real-world traffic
- Customer service chatbots handling inquiries and support
- AI-driven scientific discovery in fields like pharmaceuticals and materials science

As these agents become more sophisticated, they will not only assist but also negotiate, plan, and strategize, leading to a shift in how society functions.

### Recent Developments

- **NVIDIA's AI Blueprints:** In January 2025, NVIDIA introduced AI Blueprints designed to help enterprises build and deploy custom AI agents. These agents, referred to as "knowledge robots," can reason, plan, and take action to analyze large datasets, providing real-time insights from various data forms, including video and PDFs.

- **Microsoft's Agentic AI Frameworks:** Microsoft has developed open-source frameworks like AutoGen and Semantic Kernel to facilitate the creation and management of AI agents. AutoGen enables the development of multi-agent systems capable of complex interactions, while Semantic Kernel provides production-ready tools for integrating AI functionalities into enterprise applications.

## Key Features of an Agentic World

### Autonomous Decision-Making
AI agents are increasingly capable of making high-level decisions in sectors like finance and healthcare. For instance, Microsoft's AI initiatives in wealth management aim to reduce entry barriers for new competitors by enabling AI to perform tasks traditionally handled by large teams.

### Multi-Agent Collaboration
Intelligent agents can work together to manage complex systems. Microsoft's AutoGen framework supports the development of multi-agent systems that can interact and collaborate to solve intricate tasks, enhancing efficiency and scalability.

### Economic and Social Transformation
The integration of AI agents is leading to significant shifts in labor markets. In 2025, companies like Salesforce, Google, and Meta have reduced their human workforce, attributing layoffs to the efficiency of AI agents capable of performing tasks previously managed by humans.

### Ethical and Governance Challenges
The deployment of autonomous AI agents raises questions about security and privacy. Ensuring that these agents operate within ethical boundaries and are protected against malicious exploitation is a growing concern.

### Human-AI Symbiosis
As AI agents become more integrated into daily life, humans will increasingly collaborate with these systems. This shift necessitates new frameworks for interaction and decision-making, as well as considerations for privacy and data security.

### Internet of Things (IoT) Integration  

Sensors and connected devices provide agents with environmental data. Smart grids, for example, use agents to balance energy distribution based on demand fluctuations.  

### Decentralized Architectures  

Blockchain and edge computing enable secure, distributed decision-making. In supply chains, agents might autonomously negotiate contracts via smart contracts.  


## Challenges and Risks

Despite the promising advancements, the agentic world presents several challenges:

- **Reliability and Trust:** A significant portion of IT leaders express concerns about the reliability of AI agents, with many organizations still hesitant to fully adopt the technology. (https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/01/03/agentic-ai-a-new-paradigm-in-autonomous-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Security Concerns:** The autonomy of AI agents necessitates robust authentication and security measures to prevent unauthorized actions and ensure data privacy. (https://scet.berkeley.edu/the-next-next-big-thing-agentic-ais-opportunities-and-risks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

- **Economic Disruption:** The displacement of traditional jobs by AI agents calls for new economic models and reskilling initiatives to address potential unemployment and inequality.

## The Road Ahead

As we advance into the agentic world, collaboration between governments, industry leaders, and academia is crucial to develop policies and frameworks that guide the responsible deployment of AI agents. We believe Web3 and FHE will complement and accelerate the coming of agentic AI.

## Summary

The emergence of an agentic world signifies a transformative shift in how we interact with technology. While AI agents offer unprecedented efficiency and capabilities, careful consideration of ethical, social, and economic implications is essential to harness their potential for the collective benefit of society.
